# Canna_Project_Ironhack

This project is responding to the hypothesis

Is it still worth it to open a Marijuana business in 2023 ?

I have used the Data from the Cannabis Control Commission of Massachusetts to make this study.

And also some other study about Cannabis :
You can found all the link of the Website used in the World document named RESSOURCES 

I have also attached a Word document CANNA_PRESENTATION with all the percentage and explaining of the Tableau dashboard I have made.

How I can use this study ?

You can use this study for a project presentation ( don't hesitate to fork it, nobody will know ) or to power up the sales of your business.

You have all the numbers about, Production, retail and more, even solution to take the good decision if you own a business in Marijuana.

This is definitly a repositories you want to have a look at, just for knwoledge or to help you make a solid Business plan.

I really enjoyed to make this study, and I would love to keep improve it, with new Data so don't hesitate to Commit change if you found better file or just if you want to share better insight.
